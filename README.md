## Who We Are
**Unity Game Developmt Team** is a passionate team of game developers based in Seim Reap, Cambodia. Founded in August 22, 2023, we are dedicated to creating immersive and innovative gaming experiences for players around the world.

## Our Story
Our journey began 3 students in JPA who are in coding club working hard. After the principal saw our passion for coding, he decided to open a game development club ran by our senior, Sun Pangna. Since then, we've grown into a diverse team of designers, developers, and scripters committed to pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to transport players into a once civilized Mars and immerse themselves in different scenarios to have an idea of what it might look like. We believe in the power of games to inspire, entertain, and educate people.
